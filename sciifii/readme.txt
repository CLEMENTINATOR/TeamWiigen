This installer install the cios corp 3.6 using the network.
It will download the needed IOS from NUS and patch them to create
the cioses of the cioscorp.

If the wad files of the ioses are already on the sd card, this installer
will use them instead of downloading them.
So, this installer can also be used as an offline installer.


Please, read the da_letter_a cioscorp readme for more informations.

If your wii is connected to the network, just run this application.
You can by pass the preparation phase (the download of needed files)
putting the good wad files on the sd. To do that, read the offline
method.

If the installer hang during the download phase, you can
shutdown your wii without any problem. Delete sub folders
of the "sd:/corpfiles" folder and rerun the installer,
it will resume at the latest downloaded ios.

If your wii isn't connected to the network (or if you don't want to use the network),
you can put the ioses wad files on the sd. The installer will bypass the download if
the ios wad is already on the sd.
You need to put the wads in the corpfiles directory (ie "sd:/corpFiles").
The wad need to be renamed like IOSxxvyy.wad, where xx is the ios number
and yy the version of the ios.
For exemple, the ios 60 version 6174 needs to be renamed as IOS60v6174.wad.

Here is the list of needed wads for the offline mode (all these ios are available with NUSD):
IOS28v1293.wad
IOS33v2834.wad
IOS35v3092.wad
IOS36v3094.wad
IOS37v3612.wad
IOS38v3610.wad
IOS41v3091.wad
IOS43v3091.wad
IOS45v3091.wad
IOS46v3093.wad
IOS50v4889.wad
IOS52v5661.wad
IOS53v5149.wad
IOS55v5149.wad
IOS56v5405.wad
IOS60v6174.wad
