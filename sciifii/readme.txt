This app goal is to hack your wii without having to launch many
homebrews. You just need the HBC.
It will download the needed files from NUS and patch them to create
the cioses and all other features.

If the required files are already on the sd card, this installer
will use them instead of downloading them.
So, this installer can also be used as an offline installer.


Please, read the da_letter_a cioscorp readme for more informations on the corp.

* Instructions *
*--------------*

To hack your wii, you just need to select one of the two hack options.
Using these options, the cios rev17(b) will be installed on your wii and
the latest ioses and titles will beinstalled (ie system Menu 4.2). You
can choose too install or not the CiosCorp selecting the good option.

Expert users can select the advanced mode. Doing that you will be able
to choose the steps you want to do (for exemple, your IOS36 has the
trucha bug, so you can bypass the trucha step).

Then, you can "virginise" your wii selecting the Uninstallation option.
This will install titles from 4.2 system (including the stubs on slots
249, 250 etc...). The only things to do will be to remove the HBC using
Hackmii.
